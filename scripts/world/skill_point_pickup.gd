class_name SkillPointPickup
extends Area2D
## A hidden skill-point pickup (issue #24). Touching it awards its points
## through GameState and records the collection through SaveManager, which
## writes the save immediately so the reward can never be re-farmed by
## quitting before the next checkpoint. An instance whose secret_id is
## already in the loaded save frees itself before the player can see it.
