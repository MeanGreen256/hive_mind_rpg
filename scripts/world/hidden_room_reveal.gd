## Reveals a hidden room (issue #24): the cover CanvasItem — a wall/fog shape
## drawn over the room and whatever secret it holds — stays visible until a
## player-group body walks into this trigger, then hides. The reveal itself is
## per-session cosmetics; the pickups inside persist their own collection.
