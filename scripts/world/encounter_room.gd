class_name EncounterRoom
extends Area2D
## Reusable encounter controller (issue #66). Drop one over a room, parent the
## room's enemies under its enemies root, and point exit_paths at the barriers
## that should seal the fight. Enemies stay dormant (never given a target)
## until a player-group body enters the trigger; entering seals every
## configured exit and hands the player to each enemy. Once every assigned
## enemy has died, the exits reopen and encounter_completed fires exactly once
## per attempt.
##
## Both interfaces are duck-typed so the controller never hardcodes enemy
## types or stats:
## - Enemy: any enemies-root child with a set_target(Node2D) method and an
##   enemy_died() signal (EnemyBase satisfies both).
## - Exit: a node with seal()/open() methods takes over its own presentation;
##   anything else is treated as a physical barrier — sealing shows the
##   CanvasItem and enables its collision shapes, opening does the reverse
##   (the Zone 1 boss-door pattern).
##
## The room joins RespawnController's resettable group: on player death,
## reset_to_spawn() rebuilds the assigned enemies from pristine copies
## captured before any activation and returns the room to dormant — even if
## it was already completed, matching the die-back-to-a-checkpoint loop where
## the world re-arms (DESIGN.md §3).

signal encounter_started()
signal encounter_completed()
## Fires once, right after encounter_completed, when a valid reward is paid out
## for the first clear (issue #60). Skipped on repeat clears and rooms with no
## reward_data. HUD/feedback listens here; the point total itself arrives
## through GameState.skill_points_changed.
